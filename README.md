Assignment 3:
Suppose you want to deposit a certain amount of money into a savings account and leave it alone to draw interest for the next 10 years.
At the end of 10 years, you would like to have $10,000 in the account. How much do you need to deposit today to make that happen? You can use
the following formula to find out:
P = F / (1 + r) ^n
where P is the present value, or the amount that you need to deposit today, F is the future value that you want in the account (in this case, F is $10,000),
r is the annual interest rate, and n is the number of years that you plan to let the money sit in the account.
Program Algorithm:
1. Get the designed future value
2. Get the annual interest rate
3. Get the number of years that the money will sit in the account
4. Calculate the amount that will have to be deposited.
5. Display the result of the calculation in step 4.



Assignment 4:
Please make 2 programs in C++ or Python for the following requirements
1. Please make a program to distinguish positive and negative numbers
1. Please make a program to distinguish odd and even numbers



Assignment 5:
The programming topic of this assignment is a vending machine. Please read the following programming requirements.
1.There are a total of 5 drinks: i) Coke, ii) Sprite, iii) Mountain Dew, iv) Dr. Pepper, and v) PowerAde
2.The prices of each item are as follows: a.Coke: $.50b.Sprite: $1.00c.Mountain Dew: $1.25d.Dr.Pepper:$.75e.PowerAde: $1.50
3.The first message that your program should display is “Please put the money in: $”, so users need toenter an amount like 1, 1.50, 2, etc.
4.Next,  users have  to type  the  number  between  1  and  5to  choose  an  item(1:  Coke,  2:  Sprite,  3: Mountain Dew, 4: Dr. Pepper, and 5: PowerAde).
  If users type any other numbers, your program should display an error message like “Wrong Option! Please choose a correct item: ”.
5.After users pick out the drink from the vending machine, yourprogram should show the change. For example, if users enter 1.50 and choose a Coke,
  the program should show a change of $1.
6.The program should run until users spend all the money they enteredI am attaching the screenshots of theoutput screen. Please see Figures below.
  Please also keep in mind that this program can be improved in a variety of ways. Therefore, I recommend you to create a better program than the screenshots
  attached through the coding skills you have learned.



Assignment 6:
1.This  assignment  helps  you  understand  the  concept  of  a  function.  This  assignment  refers  to Fibonacci Series.
  According to the concept of Fibonacci series in terms of mathematics, the next number is the summation of previous two numbers.
  For  example,  if a  user types  5 and wants to display 5 Fibonacci series numbers, your program should display 0, 1, 1, 2, 3.
2.Assignment requirements for both Python and C++ users:a.Since this assignment refers  to defining multiple functions,
  I want you to define at least TWOfunctions named "main" and "fibo". If needed, you can define more than 2 functions.b.
  If a user types any numbers lower than 0, your program should show an error message like "Incorrect number!! Your number must be greater than 1!!"
3.Please see figures below for the example of output screen



Assignment 7:
Please make 3 programs for selection, bubble, and insertion sort in descending order.



Assignment 8:
Please make a program in either C++ or Python for binary search. Assume that the following array / list is given:
arr[size] = {7, 5, 1, 2, 4} in C++
lst = [7, 5, 1, 2, 4] in Python
Before applying the binary search algorithm, you need to sort array / list elements in ascending order first.
Since you have learned 3 sort algorithms, you can apply one of them before implementing the binary search function.
Your program should display "Search Found!" or "Search Not Found" depending on user's input.
For example, if a user types 3, your program should display "Search Not Found!". If a user types 7, your program displays "Search Found!".




Assignment 10:
For C++ users: As I already mentioned in class last Friday, I want C++ users to make a program to calculate a distance between 2 coordinates
based on the concept of a structure.  Please make this program and turn it in.
